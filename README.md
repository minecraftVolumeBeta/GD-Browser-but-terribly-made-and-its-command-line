## Description

Literally just a GD Browser by Colon clone but i cant make a UI and its local and its command line and theres basically 5 features.
(I kinda did manage to make a level analysis thing tho)
Best i can do for now LMFAO.

## How to use

I think downloading everything/pulling this repo and then just using ```python.exe mainMenu.py``` in the directory would work. (I suck at programming and have NO idea what I am doing, and tbh idk if that even works)

so uh key features! (yay)
> somehow a level analysis! (colon removed it from GDBrowser and obviously it was much better than mine but i mean anything > 0, its simple math.
> regular searching for levels! (use gdbrowser for that one lol dont use mine its trash)
> likeGJItem211 (??????)
> get comments from any user or any level! (also 100% worse than gdbrowser)
> POST comments as your account to a level or your own profile! (requires login because yes rob did think of some post request originating from nonexistent accountIDs, hes not THAT bad)
> get anyone's profile! (PLEASE USE [THIS](https://gdbrowser.com/search) INSTEAD WHY ARE YOU USING TS)
> get your own friends and blocked users! (what)

please note that rate limits exist and i am NOT responsible for you getting IP blocked from rob's servers if you decide to download the FULL RAW LEVEL DATA of khorne 23 times per second.

## Bugs

I am CERTAIN that this thing has at least like 359 bugs that i somehow missed when uploading ts.
Doesn't help that rob's server responses look like if a cat fell asleep on the keyboard

Thanks to wyliemaster's [GD Documentation](https://wyliemaster.github.io/gddocs/#/) website, if it wasn't for him I could NEVER figure all ts out lol

## Footnote

This project is completely unfinished so literally **any** contribution/bug hunters would help. This is by no means actively maintained by me as this is kind of a personal project done for a laugh (long story short i lost a bet). If you encounter any MAJOR bugs (like leaking data and stuff), please DO immediately report it. I'll probably fix it when I see it (and make sure to add like 10 exclamation marks to your report title so i can remind myself how much i screwed up!)

Also if this project for absolutely no reason blows up somehow, i *might* transfer ownership to someone who has much more time than me because i already know aint no way i will have time to handle more than 3 bug reports or feature requests per day LOL
