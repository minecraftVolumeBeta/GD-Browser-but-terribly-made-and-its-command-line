# GD Browser but terrible and its command line

## Description

Literally just a GD Browser by Colon clone but i cant make a UI and its local and its command line and theres basically 5 features.
(I kinda did manage to make a level analysis thing tho)
Best i can do for now LMAO.

## How to use

I think downloading everything/pulling this repo and then just using ```python.exe mainMenu.py``` in the directory would work. (I suck at programming and have NO idea what I am doing)

## Bugs

I am CERTAIN that this thing has at least like 359 bugs that i somehow missed when uploading ts.
Doesn't help that rob's server responses look like if a cat fell asleep on the keyboard

## Credits

Thanks to wyliemaster's GD Documentary website, if it wasn't for him I could NEVER figure all ts out lol

## Footnote

This project is completely not finished so any contribution would help.
